# Waze Project

1 - Python

Welcome to the Waze Project!

Your Waze data analytics team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, May Santner. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that your team has been given access to Waze's user data. To get clear insights, the user data must be inspected and prepared for the upcoming process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).
